6,liveness,float64,Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live.
7,loudness,float64,The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks.
