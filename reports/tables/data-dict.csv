Column,data type,description
song_duration_ms,float64,The duration of the track in milliseconds.
acousticness,float64,A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic.
danceability,float64,"Describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity."
energy,float64,"Represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale."
instrumentalness,float64,"Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. ""Ooh"" and ""aah"" sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly ""vocal""."

liveness,float64,Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live.
loudness,float64,The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks.

n_levels: 2"
speechiness,float64,"This detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value."
tempo,float64,"The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece, and derives directly from the average beat duration."
time_signature,int64,"An estimated overall time signature of a track. The time signature (meter) is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure).
n_levels: 4"
audio_valence,float64,"Describes the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry)."
